## What Is This Monstrosity?

Welcome to the Auto-Clicker That Could Melt Antarctica™! This is a Python script that turns your innocent computer into a click-generating machine capable of performing more clicks per second than there are stars in the visible universe (approximately 3,200 CPS and counting...).

## Features

- **Toggle with F6**: One press to release the kraken, another to make it stop
- **Multi-Threaded Overkill**: 16 threads of clicking power because why use 1 when you can use 16?
- **No Speed Limits**: This isn't your grandma's auto-clicker. We've stripped out all safety features!
- **Real-Time Stats**: Watch in horror as your click count approaches astronomical numbers
- **Free Mouse Button Replacement**: Because yours will probably wear out after using this

## Usage

1. Run the script (preferably not on anything important)
2. Position your mouse where you want a million clicks
3. Press F6 to toggle between "normal computer" and "clicking apocalypse"
4. Press Ctrl+C in the terminal when you've had enough destruction

## Warning Labels

⚠️ **YOUR COMPUTER MAY QUESTION ITS LIFE CHOICES**  
⚠️ **ACHIEVES SPEEDS OF UP TO 3,200+ CLICKS PER SECOND AND RISING**  
⚠️ **MAY CAUSE WEBSITES TO BEG FOR MERCY**  
⚠️ **NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR BROKEN GAMES, WEBSITES, OR RELATIONSHIPS**

## How to Stop When Things Go Wrong

1. Frantically press F6 (or just once as it might just restart it)
2. If that fails, CTRL+C in terminal
3. If that fails, pull the power cord
4. If all else fails, throw computer into nearest large body of water*

*For legal reasons, this is a joke. Please don't do this.

## Serious Note

This auto-clicker is actually super powerful. With great clicking power comes great responsibility. Don't use it to break things, exploit games, or annoy people. Be nice.
